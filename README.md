First, please use the citNet_dataPrep.R to generate data files needed for simulations.

Then use null_model.cpp to run the null model. 

Some code for further analyses can be found in citNet_main.R.

# Data details
The data we provide here are obtained through Clarivate Web of Science, for papers published in Political Science journals between 1900 and 2017. After some processing, we store the data in three files: doiYear.RData, Barabasi_cite.RData, and citationBara.csv. 

# Notes
Here we upload a dataset of a relatively small discipline in order to help readers replicate our analysis, and we note that the effects reported in our paper might not be present if the scientific community is not large enough.
